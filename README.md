# r-JHLNDP Mathematical Models and Instances
This repository contains the implementation of exact and heuristic algorithms for solving the Junction Hub Location and Network Design Problem (r-JHLNDP). The problem involves selecting hub locations and designing hub networks with specific topologies such as lines, trees, cycles, or star-shaped structures.

The repository includes:
	•	Three algorithm variants: BBC1, BBC2, BBC3 (based on Benders Branch-and-Cut) and Mathueristics.
	•	Instance data files used for testing and benchmarking.
	•	Scripts for running models and analyzing results.

These codes were developed as part of research work on solving large-scale topological hub location problems using optimization and matheuristic techniques.
